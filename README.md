## Introduction
Infrastructure failure is a well known BGS state. You are probably aware of its effects on gold prices from CMDR Mechan's merit farming video https://youtu.be/Ju1t9RlfnVQ.
Of course with the merit farming method you don't make any money because you are buying gold at full price.

But what if you could buy the gold truely at that 90% discount of infrastructure failure? You could make 63k profit/ton at ideal conditions.
Now if you go to Inara and look for these stations in infrastructure failure you will see that all the stations are out of stock. Because Inara will list them as the top trade route by profit and they will get swarmed like a swarm of locusts and suck up all the stock.

But there are stations that are hidden from Inara. Because the site depends on user data and the bubble is so huge that not all stations are updated all the time.
This bot will detect the stations that are in infrastructure failure but without an updated market. So they will have ample stocks of gold for you to profit.

## Bot Setup
Invite the bot using this link https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1415805825364267151

Give the bot permission to see a channel named exactly "market-watch".
Optionally create a role named exactly "Market Alert" to get pinged.

## Usage
After setting up the bot in your server simply wait for pings. Successful gold detections will occur sometimes a few times a week, sometimes once a month. Alerts have a cooldown of 48 hours. Sometimes some fields of the message will be "unknown". These stations are still worth visiting because sometimes Inara does not get full market data due to colonization.

Once you get a message just go to the station in your hauling ship (and your carrier if you have one) and then start buying the gold. You can use Inara commodity search to find good gold sell prices nearby. Or you can load your carrier to the top and then find good sell prices later. You can make hundreds of millions of credits by doing this and this is definitely the best trading you can find outside of much rarer special conditions. 

Note: when you get to the station you will see the stock is much lower then the bot reported. The stock will actually refill over time until all of the stock it originally had is gone so do not worry.
